# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Equitable Use:**
Our Hr system is free to use and provides the same functionality for all types of users. All the application’s features are provided for free, and there are no additional features at a cost. Therefore, it has identical usability for all its users. The application does not have any features that require 
any advanced skills or an advanced level of education to use, so it does not stigmatize or segregate against any type of user. Our UI design is simple and easy 
to use, making it appealing to all users. The exact form of security and privacy is provided to all users of the system.

# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Flexibility in Use:**
The Human Resource system exhibits limited flexibility in user preferences. Some of our functions have different approaches for reaching the same output 
depending on the user preference. For example, a user can decide whether they wish to search for a worker by name or ID number. Department heads can be searched 
by either number of years of experience or ID number.
Some features we could implement given more time would be searching using more attributes, such as schedule or department. In addition, we could provide more 
methods of use for the user.  

# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Simple and Intuitive Use:**
A simple and intuitive use would require that our design is easy to understand. Although our options menu is relatively simple to understand, there is much that 
we could expand here. If we had more time, we would implement a graphical user interface to display the options instead of a command-line interface. This would 
make it easier for the user to use functions through buttons rather than typing. This would enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the user.  This would also 
allow us to have nested GUIs in order to not display all options to the user at once, making the design on each page much more straightforward. 

# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Perceptible Information:**
The options menu runs in the command-line interface, and we provided enough space between the options. This maximizes the legibility of essential information to 
the extent that we can. The display of information inherits its appearance from the program that it runs in. In the future, we could implement a graphical user 
interface and have it use sizeable bold text and contrasting colours to maximize legibility for all essential information. The program maximizes the number of 
modes for displaying information that the command line interface has. It’s easy to differentiate elements of the HR system because of the simplicity of the 
options menu. Going further, we can create a graphical user interface because then it’ll be easier to implement the principles of perceptible information. 

# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Tolerance for Error:**
The HR system has a couple of features relating to the tolerance for error design principle. For example, if the user inputs incorrect information, the software 
will display relevant messages such as “invalid input, please try again” or “worker/department head not found.'' Furthermore, we implemented an undo feature for 
this very purpose. In case of mistypes/errors during functions, the user can undo the previous operation, giving them a chance to fix their mistake and 
increasing the software’s tolerance for error.

# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Low Physical Effort:**
The system is fully functional from a body position, and the simplicity of the options menu allows the users to use reasonable operating force to access all the 
features of the program. The system’s operating menu also allows the user to use minimal physical effort and barely any repetitive actions. Going further, we 
could implement a graphical user interface that retains the menu’s simplicity so that it fully adheres to the low physical effort principle.


# **Adhere, or potential feature adheres to Size and Space for Approach and Use:**
This principle does not apply to our program, as our entire software is on the computer. Therefore, regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility, the 
program will run the same. The screen can be maximized to the size of the screen as we are using a command-line interface.
